# Chapter 8 — Local vs. Global Optimization

**Prerequisites:** [Ch 01 — What Engineering Actually Optimizes](ch01-what-engineering-optimizes.md), [Ch 03 — Coupling and Cohesion](ch03-coupling-and-cohesion.md), [Ch 06 — Cost Models and Mechanical Sympathy](ch06-cost-models-and-mechanical-sympathy.md). Specifically: the latency vs. throughput tension from Ch 01, the distributed monolith failure mode from Ch 03, and the latency hierarchy from Ch 06.

**New vocabulary introduced:** Little's Law, Theory of Constraints, Conway's Law, backpressure

**Key takeaways:**
- A system is not the sum of its components. System performance is determined by interaction effects — contention, shared resources, queuing behavior — not by the performance of individual parts in isolation. A component that improves locally often makes the system worse globally.
- Throughput is bounded by the bottleneck, not by any average. Optimizing a non-bottleneck component has near-zero impact on system throughput. Identifying the bottleneck is the prerequisite to all effective performance work.
- Little's Law (L = λW) is the mathematical reason local latency improvements can cause global collapse: reducing W can increase λ, which grows L faster than W shrank, resulting in higher end-to-end latency under load.
- Conway's Law is local vs. global optimization applied to organizational structure. Teams that optimize for their own delivery velocity produce systems that mirror their communication boundaries — which may not be the correct boundaries for the system.

## Purpose

Most performance work is locally rational and globally destructive. Engineers optimize what they can see: a function, a service, a query. But systems don't execute in isolation. They execute as coupled networks of queues, contention, and shared resources. Improving one component often increases pressure on another. A service that processes requests faster may do so by creating more load on a downstream database that was already the limiting constraint.

This chapter formalizes why "making things faster" at the component level frequently makes the system slower overall, and what it means to reason about performance as a property of systems rather than of components.

## Systems Are Not Sums of Components

**What it is:** A system's performance is not the aggregate of its parts' performances. It is determined by interaction effects: contention for shared resources, queue behavior under load, and coordination overhead. Components share CPUs, database connections, network bandwidth, thread pools, and locks — and improving one component often shifts pressure onto another.

**Why it matters:** The intuition that "improving X improves the system" is locally true and globally false when X is not the binding constraint. An engineering team can spend months making a service measurably faster and produce no improvement in the metric users actually experience.

**Options:**
1. **Local optimization** — improve individual components independently
2. **Global optimization** — identify and address system-wide bottlenecks and flow constraints
3. **Mixed** — bounded local tuning under explicit system-level constraints

**Trade-offs:**
- *Local optimization:* easy to measure and deliver, but often irrelevant to system-level behavior. It is the kind of work that produces impressive benchmark results and no observable change to end-user latency.
- *Global optimization:* requires reasoning across component boundaries and shared resources, which is harder to scope, but is the only path to real throughput improvements when the system is bottleneck-constrained.

**Common failure modes:**
- Reducing a service's latency while the downstream database that it now calls more frequently remains saturated.
- Scaling a stateless service horizontally while the shared resource it depends on (a database, a connection pool, a lock) stays at fixed capacity.
- Adding replicas that create a thundering-herd effect on a shared resource that was already near its limit.

**Example:** A service optimized from 50 ms to 10 ms latency may suddenly receive 5× more traffic from upstream callers, because the upstream caller now perceives it as fast enough to call more aggressively. Under Little's Law, if arrival rate increases faster than processing time decreases, queue depth grows — and end-to-end latency worsens despite the local improvement. **[Consensus: before optimizing any component, identify the system bottleneck — if the component is not the bottleneck, the optimization does not improve system throughput]**

## Theory of Constraints

**What it is:** Goldratt's Theory of Constraints states that in any multi-stage system, throughput is bounded by the slowest stage. An hour of capacity gained at the bottleneck is an hour gained system-wide. An hour of capacity gained at any non-bottleneck stage has no effect on system throughput — it only creates more inventory waiting in front of the bottleneck.

**Why it exists:** In a pipeline of dependent stages — an API gateway, an auth service, business logic, a database — data can only flow as fast as the slowest node. Everything upstream of the bottleneck generates work that accumulates in front of it. Improving upstream stages makes that accumulation happen faster, not slower.

**Options:**
1. **Elevate the bottleneck** — direct capital, hardware, or engineering effort at the bottleneck to increase its absolute capacity
2. **Subordinate to the bottleneck** — intentionally throttle fast upstream components so they do not overwhelm the bottleneck

**Trade-offs:**
- *Elevate:* permanently increases global system throughput, but is usually expensive and shifts the bottleneck to a new location — which must then be found and addressed.
- *Subordinate:* requires no capital and immediately stabilizes the system by preventing upstream components from overloading the bottleneck. The cost is that fast upstream components idle their CPUs, and their local performance metrics look worse.

**When to choose each:**
- *Elevate:* when the bottleneck's maximum throughput is below the system's SLO and there is no cheaper way to meet it.
- *Subordinate:* when upstream components are generating load faster than the bottleneck can absorb, causing queue bloat or cascading failure.

**Common failure modes:**
- **Optimizing the non-bottleneck:** an engineering team rewrites a JSON parser in Rust, reducing its latency from 10 ms to 1 ms. The parser immediately feeds a legacy database query taking 500 ms. Global latency improved by 1.7% — nine weeks of engineering effort spent on a number no user would ever notice.
- **The thundering herd:** 50 stateless service instances each maintain their own database connection pool to maximize local throughput. Collectively they exhaust the database's connection limit, bringing the entire architecture down — while every individual service continues reporting healthy local metrics.

**Example:** In a microservices system, adding API server replicas does nothing if the PostgreSQL connection pool is saturated. The database is the bottleneck; all upstream scaling is irrelevant until that constraint is addressed. This is also why the fix to a thundering herd is often subordination — rate limiting or backpressure — rather than scaling, because the bottleneck is a shared resource with a hard capacity ceiling.

## Little's Law: Queue Depth, Arrival Rate, and Latency

**What it is:** Little's Law is the foundational theorem of queuing theory. For any stable system:

```
L = λW
```

Where L is the average number of requests in the system (queue depth), λ is the arrival rate of requests, and W is the average time a request spends in the system (latency). These three variables are coupled — you cannot independently optimize any two without affecting the third.

**Why it matters:** It provides the mathematical basis for why a local latency improvement can cause global system collapse. Reducing W makes the service appear faster upstream, which increases λ — and if λ grows faster than W shrank, L grows, increasing real latency under load.

**Options:**
1. **Unbounded queues** — allow upstream services to send unlimited requests; never reject; absorb load with queue depth
2. **Backpressure / load shedding** — enforce a hard upper bound on queue depth (L); reject new requests once full, forcing upstream callers to handle the rejection

**Trade-offs:**
- *Unbounded queues:* protects upstream services from having to write retry or error-handling logic. But during a traffic spike, when λ exceeds processing capacity, L grows without bound. Since memory is finite, the node eventually crashes, destroying all queued work with it.
- *Backpressure:* mathematically guarantees the node cannot crash from queue exhaustion alone. Forces upstream callers to handle 503 responses, which requires error-handling logic distributed across the architecture — a real engineering cost.

**When to choose each:**
- *Unbounded queues:* background analytical workloads where requests are written to durable storage (like Kafka) before processing, and processing latency can safely stretch to hours without losing data.
- *Backpressure:* all synchronous, latency-sensitive request paths in distributed systems.

**Common failure modes:**
- **Distributed monolith fan-out:** Service A is rewritten to use asynchronous, non-blocking I/O. To process one request, it now makes 5 parallel calls to Service B instead of 1 sequential call. Service A's local latency drops. But it just multiplied Service B's arrival rate (λ) by 5. Service B's queue depth (L) explodes, latency skyrockets, and end-to-end performance worsens. Intended decoupling became catastrophic load amplification.
- Focusing on average latency while ignoring queue depth — a service can report excellent p50 latency while its queue grows unbounded and p99 degrades.

**Example:** A microservice optimized from 50 ms to 10 ms increases its caller's effective request rate by 5×. Under Little's Law, if the downstream database cannot absorb that arrival rate increase, queue depth grows, per-request wait time grows, and actual end-to-end latency increases despite the local improvement. The optimization that looked like a win in isolation was a loss at the system level.

## Conway's Law: Organizational Structure as a System Constraint

**What it is:** Conway's Law (1967): organizations that design systems are constrained to produce designs that mirror their own communication structures. Teams optimize for their own local delivery velocity; to minimize the friction of coordinating with other teams, they decouple their codebases. In doing so, they push integration complexity out of the compiler and into the runtime network.

**Why it exists:** Conway's Law is local vs. global optimization applied to human beings rather than services. Each team is optimizing locally — for their own autonomy, their own deployment pipeline, their own technology choices. The global system they collectively produce reflects those local optimizations, not any architectural intent.

**Options:**
1. **Conway-aligned design** — accept that team structure shapes the architecture, and design both together (the "Inverse Conway Maneuver": restructure teams to produce the desired architecture)
2. **Decouple architecture from team structure** — maintain a different system boundary than the organizational boundary, requiring strong cross-team coordination discipline
3. **Ignore organizational structure** — accept whatever architecture emerges from team dynamics without making the coupling explicit

**Trade-offs:**
- *Conway-aligned design:* reduces coordination cost and allows teams to ship independently, but risks entrenching suboptimal architectural boundaries wherever organizational history placed them.
- *Decoupled architecture:* can achieve better system decomposition, but requires sustained coordination overhead — teams working against their natural organizational gravity.
- *Ignoring it:* produces fragmented, inconsistent systems where the actual system boundaries are discovered during incidents rather than designed.

**When to choose each:**
- *Conway-aligned:* mature organizations with stable team structures and enough engineering discipline to make team boundaries intentional rather than accidental.
- *Decoupled:* organizations where the business domain genuinely requires different decomposition than team structure provides, and leadership is willing to invest in the coordination cost.
- *Small teams:* organizational structure is fluid and Conway's Law applies less strongly — but watch for it as the organization grows.

**Common failure modes:**
- **The artificial boundary:** a company structures itself into a "Frontend Team" and a "Backend API Team." The resulting architecture has a heavily coupled, chatty API layer regardless of what the architects intended — the teams optimized locally for their own technology stacks and produced a system that mirrors that boundary.
- Microservices split along team boundaries rather than domain boundaries — producing a distributed monolith where each service owns a database but the services remain tightly coupled through synchronous call chains.
- Shared databases used to bypass organizational friction — two teams that cannot agree on an API boundary share a database table instead, creating the coupling without the explicit contract.

**Example:** A company structured as "Frontend," "Backend," and "Data" teams reliably produces a three-layer architecture regardless of what the domain model suggests. A company that restructures into "Order Management," "Inventory," and "Customer" teams — product verticals rather than technical horizontals — reliably produces services with those domain boundaries instead. The system architecture follows the communication structure. This is not optional; the only question is whether the organizational structure was designed to produce the system architecture that is actually needed.

## Why Smart Engineers Disagree

The persistent tension in this chapter is about the boundary of responsibility — specifically, where a component owner's accountability ends and the system's behavior begins.

Engineers optimizing for component predictability — often service owners — want their specific service to be correct, fast, and observable in isolation. If their service returns 200s in 5 ms, they have done their job. If the downstream database crashes because of their throughput, that is the database team's scaling problem, not theirs. This is locally rational. It is also the reason systems collapse while all individual services report healthy.

Engineers optimizing for emergent system behavior — principal architects, SREs — view local perfection as a threat. They understand that the system is zero-sum. They will intentionally degrade a single service's local performance — enforcing rate limits, adding jitter, introducing synchronous delays — specifically to protect a shared global resource. From the service owner's dashboard, this looks like artificial throttling. From the user's perspective, it is the difference between the checkout page loading and timing out.

The mathematical frameworks in this chapter — Little's Law, Theory of Constraints, Conway's Law — all converge on the same conclusion: system behavior is governed by constraints outside any single component's control. The component owner looking at their service dashboard and the systems engineer looking at end-to-end latency are looking at different systems. The user experiences only one of them.
