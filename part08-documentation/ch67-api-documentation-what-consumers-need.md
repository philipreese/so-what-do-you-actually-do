# Ch 67 — API Documentation: What Consumers Need

**Prerequisites:** [Error Handling Contracts](../part03-api-design/ch21-error-handling-contracts.md), [Authentication and Authorization Boundaries](../part03-api-design/ch24-authentication-authorization-boundaries.md), [Internal vs. External API Design](../part03-api-design/ch25-internal-vs-external-api-design.md) (Hyrum's Law), [Keeping Documentation Honest](ch66-keeping-documentation-honest.md)

**New vocabulary introduced:** None — this chapter applies Principle 8 and Hyrum's Law (Ch 25) to API reference content specifically, rather than introducing new concepts.

**Key takeaways:**
- An API consumer is a structurally different reader from every other audience in this Part: often without access to the implementation, without knowledge of internal conventions, and — for an external API (Ch 25) — sometimes outside the organization entirely. The documentation isn't supplemental to the interface; it *is* the interface as far as the consumer is concerned.
- [Strong Recommendation] Generate the reference layer — operations, request and response shapes, types, status codes — mechanically from the interface definition wherever tooling allows. A generated reference cannot drift from what it's generated from the way hand-written prose can. Reserve hand-writing for what generation can't produce: getting-started narrative, integration patterns, and working examples.
- A runnable, copyable example answers "how do I make this request" faster than a paragraph re-describing fields a generated parameter table already shows.
- Hyrum's Law (Ch 25) applies directly to documentation completeness: an incomplete or ambiguous contract doesn't prevent consumers from depending on undocumented behavior — it only hides that dependency from the API owner until a change breaks it.
- An explicit non-guarantee ("iteration order is not defined," "this field may be null") is a documented defense against Hyrum's Law, not just a descriptive courtesy — it's what lets the API owner change the undocumented part later without breaking anyone who was told not to rely on it.

## For My Wife

Assembling furniture from a box with only the included instructions is a very particular kind of reading: there's no calling the factory, no looking at how it was actually built, nothing but that one booklet standing between you and a finished bookshelf. That's why the parts list at the front has to be exactly right — the actual count of screws, the actual panels — and why the best manufacturers generate that list directly from what's really in the box rather than having someone type up a description from memory. A typed-up list can say "12 screws" when the machine that packed the box actually put in 10, and now you're stuck disassembling half a bookshelf trying to figure out whether you lost two screws or the list was wrong from the start.

This chapter argues that documentation for other programs to talk to should be built the same way — generated straight from the actual interface wherever possible, so the description can never drift out of sync with what's really there, with a person only writing the parts a machine can't: the getting-started walkthrough, the "here's actually how you'd use this" examples nobody can auto-generate from a parts list alone.

**And the smartest instruction booklets also say what they're not promising — "panel color may vary slightly by batch," say — because that one sentence is what protects the manufacturer from an angry call the day they change the finish slightly.** Software documentation needs the same kind of honesty: stating plainly what isn't guaranteed is what allows a detail to change later without it counting as breaking a promise nobody actually made.

## For My Kids

Say you're the one who knows the house — where the dog's leash is, what your little brother's actually allowed to eat, when bedtime really is — and tonight a babysitter's covering while your parents are somewhere with no signal for four hours. You write it all down before you leave.

The instructions describing your actual house, right now, beat instructions describing whatever you remember from months ago. If your brother's allergic to peanuts as of this year, that goes on the card exactly as it stands today, not as loosely recalled as "I think he can have those now?"

The card also has to say what genuinely doesn't matter, not just what does. "Bedtime can slip to 8:30, that's fine" saves the sitter from panicking over a rule you never actually meant to be strict about.

What it shouldn't include is why your family does things a certain way. The sitter doesn't need your whole history with the dog, just where the leash actually is tonight.

Get any of this wrong, and there's no fixing it live. Nobody's answering a text for four hours. A missing detail doesn't get politely worked around — it turns into a decision the sitter has to guess at alone, with your little brother standing right there watching to see what happens.

Every other chapter in this Part assumes a reader with the source in front of them. This one doesn't. Per Ch 25's internal-vs-external distinction, an API consumer frequently can't inspect the implementation, doesn't know the team's internal conventions, and often can't just walk over and ask someone for clarification — which is exactly why API documentation earns separate treatment instead of being folded into the general README case. This chapter covers what that reader needs and how to keep it accurate; it doesn't re-derive how the interface itself should be designed — resource shapes (Ch 20), the error contract (Ch 21), and authentication schemes (Ch 24) are referenced here, not redesigned.

### Decision: Document the Contract, Not the Implementation

**What it is:** API documentation describes the interface's externally observable behavior — what a consumer can rely on — rather than how it's implemented internally.

**Why it exists:** A consumer depends on the contract, not the code behind it. Documenting implementation details invites consumers to depend on things that were never promised and that the API owner is free to change on a whim; it also goes obsolete the moment that internal detail changes, which happens far more often than the contract itself does.

**Options:** A complete reference covers, for each operation: what it does, its request and response shapes, its authentication requirement (Ch 24, referenced), its error behavior (Ch 21, referenced), and a working example. It does not cover internal algorithms, caching strategy, or other implementation choices that were never part of the promise.

**Trade-offs:** Documenting the contract gives consumers stable expectations and a low support burden, at the cost of needing to be updated alongside interface changes — a cost every option here pays in some form. Documenting implementation detail satisfies curiosity but goes stale fast and actively encourages consumers to depend on things the API owner didn't intend to promise. Minimal documentation is cheap to produce and expensive for every consumer who has to reverse-engineer the gap.

**Common failure modes:** A reference page describes an internal caching layer instead of the response contract a consumer actually integrates against; when the caching strategy changes, the documentation is now wrong about something that was never the consumer's business in the first place.

**Example:** GitHub's public API references describe requests, responses, authentication, and observable behavior — never GitHub's internal service implementation. Consumers integrate against the documented contract, which is exactly the boundary Ch 25 draws between an API's public promise and its private implementation.

### Decision: Generate the Reference Layer, Write the Narrative Layer by Hand

**What it is:** The chapter's central trade-off — whether the structural parts of an API reference (endpoints, parameters, types, status codes) are produced mechanically from the interface definition or maintained as hand-written prose — and the choice of what to reserve for a human to write.

**Why it exists:** This is Principle 8 again, applied to the most externally visible documentation this handbook covers. Reference content duplicates information that already exists somewhere authoritative — a type definition, an OpenAPI schema, a docstring. Duplicated information drifts (Ch 66); generated documentation removes the duplication entirely by deriving the reference directly from that authoritative source instead of re-describing it by hand and hoping the two stay in sync.

**Options:**
1. **Generated reference** — derived from OpenAPI/Swagger definitions, source annotations, or docstring tooling (Rustdoc, Javadoc, Sphinx).
2. **Hand-written reference** — endpoint and parameter descriptions maintained independently of the interface definition.
3. **Hybrid** — generate the structural reference; write the narrative layer — getting-started guides, integration patterns, the "why would I reach for this" context — by hand, since generation can't produce it.

**Trade-offs:** Generated reference cannot drift from the signatures it's generated from and costs little to maintain, but it can only describe what exists, not why it's organized that way or how several endpoints combine into a real integration. Hand-written reference allows richer explanation everywhere, at the cost of duplicating information the interface definition already contains and drifting from it the moment either one changes without the other. The hybrid approach pays only the maintenance cost of the narrative layer — which is exactly the kind of external documentation Ch 66 already flagged as prone to drift, because its accuracy depends on a human noticing it's wrong, not a compiler.

[Strong Recommendation] Generate everything the tooling can generate — operations, parameters, request and response schemas, status codes — and write prose only for what generation cannot produce. A working, copyable example usually communicates more than another paragraph of field descriptions the generated table already shows.

**Common failure modes:** A team maintains endpoint descriptions by hand in a separate content system despite an OpenAPI definition already existing. A field gets renamed in the schema; the hand-written page never hears about it. Consumers building against the published documentation get their requests rejected against a contract that changed weeks earlier.

**Example:** The OpenAPI specification is the dominant mechanism for generating REST reference documentation directly from a machine-readable contract; GitHub's own REST and GraphQL API references are produced this way, so a schema change propagates to the published docs automatically instead of waiting for someone to notice and update a separate page. Stripe's documentation is the industry's most cited benchmark for the narrative half of this split — precise generated reference paired with realistic, copyable, end-to-end integration examples that answer "how do I actually build this" rather than restating field names a second time.

### Decision: Document the Whole Contract, Not Just the Happy Path

**What it is:** Documenting guarantees, limitations, and explicit non-guarantees — not only the success path — as a deliberate defense against Hyrum's Law.

**Why it exists:** Ch 25 established Hyrum's Law: with enough consumers, every observable behavior becomes someone's dependency, whether it was documented or not. An incomplete or ambiguous contract doesn't prevent that — it just hides the dependency from the API owner until a change breaks it and someone files an angry ticket. Precise documentation, including explicit statements about what's *not* guaranteed, is what lets an API owner change undocumented behavior later without it counting as a breaking change.

**Options:**
1. **Exhaustive boundary definition** — state ordering guarantees (or their explicit absence), nullability, pagination behavior, rate limits, and the full error contract, not just the 200 response.
2. **Permissive, happy-path-only documentation** — describe the successful case and leave incidental behavior unmentioned.

**Trade-offs:** Exhaustive documentation costs more up front — every boundary has to actually be decided and stated, not left implicit — but it's what protects the API owner's ability to change an internal detail later; a documented non-guarantee makes that change compliant with the contract instead of a break. Permissive documentation is faster to ship initially, but every unstated behavior a consumer happens to observe is a candidate for silent, accidental dependency the API owner won't discover until changing it breaks someone.

**When to choose each:** Exhaustive documentation for any external, multi-tenant, or partner-facing API, where the blast radius of an accidental dependency is largely outside the owner's control. Permissive documentation is defensible only for a genuinely internal, single-team boundary where both sides can coordinate a change directly instead of relying on a documented contract to protect them from each other.

**Common failure modes:** An endpoint happens to return results sorted by insertion order, an artifact of the underlying query rather than a stated guarantee. The documentation says only "returns a list of users." A client builds a UI that quietly assumes that order. Months later an unrelated storage migration changes the underlying query plan, the order shifts, and the client breaks — not because the documented contract changed, but because behavior nobody documented, and therefore nobody promised, got depended on anyway.

**Example:** Java's and Rust's standard library documentation explicitly states that a hash map's iteration order is not guaranteed. That single documented non-guarantee is what lets both languages change their internal hashing implementation across releases without it counting as a breaking change — the explicit absence of a promise is doing real protective work, not just describing an implementation detail.

### Why Smart Engineers Disagree

There's little disagreement that the reference layer should be generated — that part of this chapter's position is close to consensus among experienced API designers. The disagreement is about how much hand-written narrative should sit alongside it.

One position keeps hand-written content to a minimum: generated reference plus a handful of working examples is enough, and it's substantially easier to keep accurate than a library of tutorials, since every additional hand-written page is one more thing that can drift (Ch 66) with nothing standing guard over it.

The other invests deliberately in getting-started guides, integration walkthroughs, and conceptual narrative, arguing that a successful API is measured by how quickly a new consumer becomes productive, not merely by how complete its field-level reference is — and that gap is exactly what generated reference structurally cannot close on its own.

Both positions accept the same constraint: every hand-written page is a maintenance liability the moment it's published. They differ on how much onboarding value that liability is worth. In practice the answer tracks how cold the audience is — an API consumed entirely by engineers already familiar with the domain gets by fine on reference and examples; one meant to onboard unfamiliar external developers, the way Stripe's is, earns the narrative investment, because the alternative is a support queue answering the same "how do I actually start" question by hand, one ticket at a time, forever.
