# Appendix B — Common Engineering Smells

This appendix is an index, not a chapter. It catalogs the mundane, observable signals an engineer actually notices — in a pull request, a dashboard, a standup — that a decision from one of the 90 chapters may have been made poorly, or not made deliberately at all.

A smell is a prompt to investigate, not a verdict. Every entry below includes a **false positive**: a specific, concrete situation where the exact same observable symptom is the correct result of a deliberate trade-off this handbook itself argues for. Treating a smell as an automatic defect regardless of context is its own failure mode — the mechanical version of ignoring Chesterton's fence, tearing it down because nobody bothered asking why it was there. Use this appendix to know where to look, not to skip the judgment call the linked chapter actually walks through.

## 1. Architecture & Coupling Smells

**The Shared-Database Schema Mutation Outage**
*What you observe:* Renaming a column or altering a table in the primary database breaks a completely separate service, one nobody touched in the pull request that caused it.
*Usually a symptom of:* Two services sharing a database instead of each owning its own — a distributed monolith at the data layer.
*Full treatment:* [Ch 10 — Monolith vs. Service Decomposition](../part02-software-architecture/ch10-monolith-vs-service-decomposition.md), [Ch 18 — Data Ownership Boundaries](../part02-software-architecture/ch18-data-ownership-boundaries.md)
*False positive:* A deliberate modular monolith, deployed as a single compilation unit, where the compiler enforces internal boundaries at build time and a shared schema carries no runtime coupling risk.

**The Persistent Strangler Stub**
*What you observe:* An architecture diagram shows 95% of traffic routed through new services, but a permanent, unowned 5% slice still hits a legacy core nobody will touch.
*Usually a symptom of:* A stalled strangler-fig migration, quietly paying the full operational cost of two competing architectures indefinitely.
*Full treatment:* [Ch 10 — Monolith vs. Service Decomposition](../part02-software-architecture/ch10-monolith-vs-service-decomposition.md) (the strangler fig pattern)
*False positive:* A deliberate, permanent anti-corruption layer isolating a clean internal domain from an immutable third-party system that was never meant to be fully replaced.

**The Cross-Layer Pull Request**
*What you observe:* A single user-visible feature requires touching UI, business logic, persistence, and infrastructure code across dozens of files.
*Usually a symptom of:* Poor boundary placement — a change that should have stayed local to one concern turned into a change to the whole system.
*Full treatment:* [Ch 03 — Coupling and Cohesion](../part01-systems-thinking/ch03-coupling-and-cohesion.md), [Ch 13 — Coupling and Cohesion at the Architecture Level](../part02-software-architecture/ch13-coupling-cohesion-architecture-level.md)
*False positive:* A deliberate, cross-cutting migration — introducing structured logging or replacing a serialization library — that is expected to touch everything exactly once.

**Circular Dependency Appears**
*What you observe:* The build system reports an import cycle between two modules that previously built independently.
*Usually a symptom of:* Responsibility has drifted until neither module can be said to own the thing the other now depends on.
*Full treatment:* [Ch 12 — Dependency Direction and Inversion](../part02-software-architecture/ch12-dependency-direction-inversion.md)
*False positive:* A short-lived cycle introduced mid-refactor and resolved before the branch merges.

---

## 2. API Design Smells

**The Multi-Flag God Endpoint**
*What you observe:* A single request object accumulates more than a handful of optional boolean flags (`include_history`, `skip_validation`, `dry_run`) that interact in ways no caller fully understands, including the one who added the last flag.
*Usually a symptom of:* A flat API surface standing in for what should be layered, progressively disclosed capabilities.
*Full treatment:* [Ch 15 — API Surface Design](../part02-software-architecture/ch15-api-surface-design-expose-hide.md)
*False positive:* An internal, throughput-first data pipeline where ergonomics are explicitly secondary to raw transfer efficiency.

**The Tightened Validation Input Trap**
*What you observe:* Adding a stricter validation rule to an existing field — a tighter bound on an age field, say — starts handing existing clients errors they never got before.
*Usually a symptom of:* Treating a contract tightening as a minor fix instead of the breaking change it actually is.
*Full treatment:* [Ch 16 — Versioning and Backward Compatibility](../part02-software-architecture/ch16-versioning-backward-compatibility.md)
*False positive:* An internal RPC surface where every caller lives in the same monorepo and deploys in lockstep with the change.

**The Database Schema Reflection in JSON**
*What you observe:* A public API response includes an internal surrogate key, an ORM-generated field name, or a `deleted_at` column straight off the table definition.
*Usually a symptom of:* No boundary mapping — internal representation passes straight through instead of hiding behind an explicit contract.
*Full treatment:* [Ch 04 — Abstraction and Information Hiding](../part01-systems-thinking/ch04-abstraction-and-information-hiding.md), [Ch 15 — API Surface Design](../part02-software-architecture/ch15-api-surface-design-expose-hide.md)
*False positive:* A throwaway internal tool where the same person owns both the producer and the one consumer, deployed together.

**One Endpoint Returns Different Shapes**
*What you observe:* The same endpoint returns structurally different payloads depending on a hidden flag or server-side condition the caller can't see in advance.
*Usually a symptom of:* The interface no longer represents one contract — several different operations have been collapsed into one route.
*Full treatment:* [Ch 20 — Resource Modeling](../part03-api-design/ch20-resource-modeling.md)
*False positive:* A GraphQL endpoint, where the caller explicitly requests the shape it gets back.

---

## 3. Code Organization Smells

**The Pass-Through Service Layer**
*What you observe:* A method's entire body is an unmodified call to the layer beneath it — `getUser(id)` that does nothing but `return userRepository.getUser(id)`.
*Usually a symptom of:* A layer added with no volatile decision to hide behind it — pure indirection tax, nothing purchased in return.
*Full treatment:* [Ch 14 — Abstraction Layers: When to Add One](../part02-software-architecture/ch14-abstraction-layers-when-to-add-one.md), [Ch 31 — When Abstractions Help vs. When They Obscure](../part04-code-organization/ch31-when-abstractions-help-vs-when-they-obscure.md)
*False positive:* A strictly enforced layered architecture where every tier must go through the adjacent one, and the pass-through exists to keep that invariant mechanically true even when today's implementation is trivial.

**The Core Business Logic SDK Import**
*What you observe:* A file computing domain rules — tax calculation, pricing — directly imports a cloud provider's SDK or a specific database driver.
*Usually a symptom of:* A callee-owned interface leaking vendor vocabulary straight into logic that should only speak the business's own language.
*Full treatment:* [Ch 12 — Dependency Direction and Inversion](../part02-software-architecture/ch12-dependency-direction-inversion.md)
*False positive:* Importing a genuinely foundational, stable primitive — a language's standard I/O interface — that is never going to be swapped out.

**Utility Folder Growth**
*What you observe:* `utils/`, `helpers/`, or `common/` becomes one of the largest, least-owned directories in the repository.
*Usually a symptom of:* Unrelated responsibilities piling up in a place with no cohesion, because nobody ever had to decide where they actually belonged.
*Full treatment:* [Ch 27 — File and Module Structure](../part04-code-organization/ch27-file-and-module-structure.md), [Ch 28 — Naming Conventions and When They Matter](../part04-code-organization/ch28-naming-conventions-and-when-they-matter.md)
*False positive:* A language runtime or standard library deliberately collecting broadly reusable, genuinely general-purpose primitives.

**One Class Has Hundreds of Imports**
*What you observe:* A single class directly depends on dozens of unrelated modules — validators, formatters, persistence, orchestration — all at once.
*Usually a symptom of:* A class that quietly became several classes sharing one name.
*Full treatment:* [Ch 03 — Coupling and Cohesion](../part01-systems-thinking/ch03-coupling-and-cohesion.md), [Ch 29 — When to Split Files vs. Keep Together](../part04-code-organization/ch29-when-to-split-files-vs-keep-together.md)
*False positive:* A composition root or dependency-injection bootstrap file, whose entire job is wiring together everything else exactly once.

---

## 4. Testing Smells

**The Docker-Dependent Domain Unit Test**
*What you observe:* Verifying a pure business rule — a discount calculation — requires spinning up Postgres and Redis containers and takes seconds instead of milliseconds.
*Usually a symptom of:* Business logic that was never actually decoupled from the infrastructure it happens to run next to.
*Full treatment:* [Ch 11 — Layered, Hexagonal, and Ports-and-Adapters Architecture](../part02-software-architecture/ch11-layered-hexagonal-ports-adapters.md), [Ch 36 — When to Mock vs. Use Real Dependencies](../part05-testing-strategy/ch36-when-to-mock-vs-use-real-dependencies.md)
*False positive:* A dedicated integration or smoke-test suite whose entire purpose is validating real database behavior under real conditions.

**The Mock Museum**
*What you observe:* A test needs fifty lines of stub configuration to verify a three-line method.
*Usually a symptom of:* An abstraction layer with no real complexity behind it, getting paid for in test setup instead of production code.
*Full treatment:* [Ch 14 — Abstraction Layers: When to Add One](../part02-software-architecture/ch14-abstraction-layers-when-to-add-one.md), [Ch 36 — When to Mock vs. Use Real Dependencies](../part05-testing-strategy/ch36-when-to-mock-vs-use-real-dependencies.md)
*False positive:* Testing an anti-corruption layer built specifically to translate a large, genuinely messy third-party contract — the stubbing volume reflects the vendor's real complexity, not an unnecessary layer.

**Tests Retry Until They Pass**
*What you observe:* CI is configured to automatically rerun failing tests, and a merge proceeds once a retry eventually succeeds.
*Usually a symptom of:* Flakiness normalized into pipeline policy instead of investigated as a real bug.
*Full treatment:* [Ch 57 — What Belongs in CI (and What Doesn't)](../part07-git-and-delivery/ch57-what-belongs-in-ci-and-what-doesnt.md)
*False positive:* A transient, external infrastructure outage — a cloud provider blip — genuinely outside the team's control, with the retry scoped narrowly to that dependency.

**Coverage Increases While Bugs Continue**
*What you observe:* The coverage percentage climbs sprint over sprint, but the rate of escaped defects doesn't move.
*Usually a symptom of:* Coverage became the target instead of the diagnostic it was meant to be — Principle 9 in practice.
*Full treatment:* [Ch 41 — Coverage: What It Measures and What It Doesn't](../part05-testing-strategy/ch41-coverage-what-it-measures-and-what-it-doesnt.md)
*False positive:* The early phase of building a regression suite for a codebase that had no automated tests at all — a rising floor with no history of prior coverage to compare bug rates against.

---

## 5. Engineering Process Smells

**The Speculative Technology Migration Preparation**
*What you observe:* A design doc adds an abstraction layer so the storage engine can theoretically switch from Postgres to MongoDB "just in case," with no profiling data suggesting the current database is a constraint.
*Usually a symptom of:* Paying an indirection tax today for optionality nobody has shown is actually needed.
*Full treatment:* [Ch 14 — Abstraction Layers: When to Add One](../part02-software-architecture/ch14-abstraction-layers-when-to-add-one.md) ("just in case" layers), [Ch 85 — When to Optimize (and When Not To)](../part12-performance/ch85-when-to-optimize.md)
*False positive:* A real anti-corruption boundary built around a vendor integration whose contract is already, concretely scheduled for replacement.

**The Resume-Driven Microservice Sweep**
*What you observe:* A five-person team splits a low-traffic internal tool into a dozen services, taking on distributed tracing and deployment coordination overhead in the process.
*Usually a symptom of:* Decomposition driven by industry trend, not an actual organizational or scaling constraint.
*Full treatment:* [Ch 08 — Local vs. Global Optimization](../part01-systems-thinking/ch08-local-vs-global-optimization.md) (Conway's Law), [Ch 10 — Monolith vs. Service Decomposition](../part02-software-architecture/ch10-monolith-vs-service-decomposition.md)
*False positive:* Isolating one genuinely distinct workload — a GPU-bound image-processing job — away from an otherwise ordinary stateless application, for a real hardware reason.

**The Post-Hoc Benchmark**
*What you observe:* An engineer ships a complex, hard-to-read performance rewrite, then writes a small benchmark against a toy dataset afterward to justify the pull request.
*Usually a symptom of:* Optimization performed before evidence, with the evidence built retroactively to fit a decision that was already made.
*Full treatment:* [Ch 85 — When to Optimize (and When Not To)](../part12-performance/ch85-when-to-optimize.md), [Ch 86 — Profiling-First](../part12-performance/ch86-profiling-first.md)
*False positive:* Building a foundational, shared data structure or lock-free primitive inside a platform runtime, where mechanical sympathy is a legitimate day-one design constraint rather than a speculative one.

**Design Reviews Happen After Implementation**
*What you observe:* The first real architectural discussion of a feature happens in a PR review, after thousands of lines are already written.
*Usually a symptom of:* Design validation shoved to the single most expensive point in the process to discover a flaw.
*Full treatment:* [Ch 46 — Spec-First Development](../part06-engineering-process/ch46-spec-first-development.md)
*False positive:* An exploratory prototype whose explicit purpose is discovering unknown constraints before a design is even attempted.

---

## 6. Git and Delivery Smells

**The Multi-Repo Lockstep Pull Request**
*What you observe:* One feature ticket requires three pull requests across three repositories, merged and deployed in a specific, coordinated order.
*Usually a symptom of:* Services split for deployment independence that never actually got it — a distributed monolith at the delivery layer.
*Full treatment:* [Ch 10 — Monolith vs. Service Decomposition](../part02-software-architecture/ch10-monolith-vs-service-decomposition.md), [Ch 18 — Data Ownership Boundaries](../part02-software-architecture/ch18-data-ownership-boundaries.md)
*False positive:* A coordinated emergency security patch that genuinely must land across several shared libraries at once.

**The Blocked Monolith Release Train**
*What you observe:* One engineer's unrelated bug halts the entire production deployment pipeline for every team.
*Usually a symptom of:* An organization that's outgrown the coordination model of a single, un-segmented release process.
*Full treatment:* [Ch 08 — Local vs. Global Optimization](../part01-systems-thinking/ch08-local-vs-global-optimization.md) (Conway's Law), [Ch 10 — Monolith vs. Service Decomposition](../part02-software-architecture/ch10-monolith-vs-service-decomposition.md)
*False positive:* An early-stage team that has deliberately accepted deployment coupling in exchange for maximum day-one iteration speed.

**The Permanent Feature Branch**
*What you observe:* A branch stays open for months, diverging further from main every week, while everyone waits for a "big bang" rewrite to be validated.
*Usually a symptom of:* Integration risk piling up instead of getting paid down incrementally.
*Full treatment:* [Ch 50 — Branching Strategies](../part07-git-and-delivery/ch50-branching-strategies.md)
*False positive:* A research prototype or experimental rewrite deliberately kept separate from the production delivery pipeline, with no intention of a future merge.

**Emergency Commits Directly to Main**
*What you observe:* Production fixes routinely skip normal review and land straight on the default branch.
*Usually a symptom of:* The ordinary review process isn't fast enough for the situations that actually matter, so it gets bypassed instead of adapted.
*Full treatment:* [Ch 47 — Code Review](../part06-engineering-process/ch47-code-review.md)
*False positive:* A controlled incident response, with the bypass logged and a real follow-up review scheduled — not a silent, permanent habit.

---

## 7. Documentation Smells

**The Documentation-Only Deprecation**
*What you observe:* A wiki page says an API version is deprecated, but traffic metrics show it's still serving nearly half of production requests.
*Usually a symptom of:* Treating prose as an operational control, instead of building an actual, enforced sunset lifecycle.
*Full treatment:* [Ch 16 — Versioning and Backward Compatibility](../part02-software-architecture/ch16-versioning-backward-compatibility.md) (the sunset pattern)
*False positive:* The narrow window between documenting a newly discovered issue and an automated patch pipeline finishing its rollout.

**The Outdated Architecture Legend**
*What you observe:* The system diagram shows clean service isolation, but the actual code makes direct cross-database joins the diagram doesn't mention.
*Usually a symptom of:* Documentation that stopped getting updated the moment the system it described started changing.
*Full treatment:* [Ch 66 — Keeping Documentation Honest](../part08-documentation/ch66-keeping-documentation-honest.md), [Ch 18 — Data Ownership Boundaries](../part02-software-architecture/ch18-data-ownership-boundaries.md)
*False positive:* A deliberately aspirational diagram from an early design workshop, clearly labeled as the target state rather than the current one.

**The Runbook That Starts With "Investigate"**
*What you observe:* The first step in an on-call guide is effectively "figure out what's wrong" rather than a concrete action.
*Usually a symptom of:* The document captures background knowledge, not an operational procedure.
*Full treatment:* [Ch 68 — Runbooks and Operational Documentation](../part08-documentation/ch68-runbooks-and-operational-documentation.md)
*False positive:* A genuinely new, previously unseen class of incident, where investigation really is the correct first step.

**Wiki Search Returns Conflicting Answers**
*What you observe:* Two different pages describe two different deployment processes for the same system.
*Usually a symptom of:* No single, authoritative source of truth — every page is somebody's snapshot of what was true the day they wrote it.
*Full treatment:* [Ch 66 — Keeping Documentation Honest](../part08-documentation/ch66-keeping-documentation-honest.md)
*False positive:* Documentation that intentionally maintains separate pages for multiple, currently-supported product versions.

---

## 8. Observability Smells

**The Trace-Isolation Guesswork Blindspot**
*What you observe:* An engineer stares at a distributed trace dashboard trying to guess which specific line of code, inside one service, is slow.
*Usually a symptom of:* The wrong tool for the question — a trace shows which service is slow, not why that service is slow on the inside.
*Full treatment:* [Ch 72 — Distributed Tracing](../part09-observability/ch72-distributed-tracing.md), [Ch 86 — Profiling-First](../part12-performance/ch86-profiling-first.md)
*False positive:* Using the same trace correctly to evaluate cross-service network transit time or queue delay — the question a trace is actually built to answer.

**The Blind Average Metric Illusion**
*What you observe:* A dashboard shows a healthy 50ms average latency while support tickets pile up about multi-second stalls.
*Usually a symptom of:* Measuring the mean when the thing that matters — the thing users actually experience — is the tail.
*Full treatment:* [Ch 87 — Latency vs. Throughput Trade-offs](../part12-performance/ch87-latency-vs-throughput.md) (tail latency), [Ch 73 — Error Budgets and SLOs](../part09-observability/ch73-error-budgets-and-slos.md)
*False positive:* Monitoring aggregate throughput for a fully asynchronous, decoupled background pipeline where no individual request has a user waiting on it.

**The Local Profiler Micro-Stall Illusion**
*What you observe:* A flame graph from an instrumenting profiler says a small string-parsing function is 85% of execution time; replacing it changes nothing in production.
*Usually a symptom of:* The observer effect — the profiler's own overhead distorted the exact timing it was trying to measure.
*Full treatment:* [Ch 86 — Profiling-First](../part12-performance/ch86-profiling-first.md)
*False positive:* Using an instrumenting profiler deliberately, in an offline, single-threaded investigation where exact call counts are genuinely the question being asked.

**Every Log Line Says "Starting"**
*What you observe:* Logs are full of lifecycle messages and nearly empty of business identifiers, outcomes, or request context.
*Usually a symptom of:* Logging written for the developer who wrote the code, not the operator debugging it at 2 a.m.
*Full treatment:* [Ch 69 — Logging: What to Log and at What Level](../part09-observability/ch69-logging-what-to-log-and-at-what-level.md)
*False positive:* Very early bootstrap code, running before any request context exists to attach to a log line.

---

## 9. Concurrency Smells

**The Unbounded Buffer Queue Expansion**
*What you observe:* Memory climbs steadily during a downstream stall, then the process dies in a sudden out-of-memory crash.
*Usually a symptom of:* A queue with no capacity limit, soaking up load instead of applying backpressure.
*Full treatment:* [Ch 01 — What Engineering Actually Optimizes](../part01-systems-thinking/ch01-what-engineering-optimizes.md) (buffer bloat), [Ch 08 — Local vs. Global Optimization](../part01-systems-thinking/ch08-local-vs-global-optimization.md) (Little's Law, backpressure)
*False positive:* A deliberately disk-backed, durable queue (Kafka-style) designed to absorb hours of backlog by design, not by accident.

**The Multi-Tenant Thread-Starvation Lock**
*What you observe:* Tail latency degrades sharply under load, and thread dumps show most workers blocked waiting on one global mutex.
*Usually a symptom of:* Lock granularity set far coarser than the actual contention pattern needs.
*Full treatment:* [Ch 75 — Locks: When to Use Them](../part10-concurrency/ch75-locks-when-to-use-them.md)
*False positive:* Deliberately serializing access to a genuinely singleton resource — a piece of hardware or an OS-level handle that cannot be accessed concurrently no matter how it's wrapped.

**Sleep Added to "Fix" a Race Condition**
*What you observe:* Production code contains a delay whose only purpose is giving another thread time to finish first.
*Usually a symptom of:* A real data race papered over with timing instead of fixed with actual synchronization.
*Full treatment:* [Ch 74 — Shared State vs. Message Passing](../part10-concurrency/ch74-shared-state-vs-message-passing.md) (data race)
*False positive:* An intentional, documented backoff delay when retrying a call to a rate-limited external system.

**The Redundant Event Fan-Out Echo**
*What you observe:* One user action produces fifty overlapping, near-duplicate events on a message bus, and every consumer has to filter them back down.
*Usually a symptom of:* Weak bounded-context boundaries — several producers all believe they own the responsibility to announce the same change.
*Full treatment:* [Ch 13 — Coupling and Cohesion at the Architecture Level](../part02-software-architecture/ch13-coupling-cohesion-architecture-level.md) (event-driven decoupling), [Ch 17 — Synchronous vs. Asynchronous Communication](../part02-software-architecture/ch17-sync-vs-async-communication.md)
*False positive:* A deliberate broadcast, feeding several independent read-optimized projections (CQRS) that are each expected to receive the same event.

---

## 10. Security Smells

**Secrets in Source Control**
*What you observe:* An API key, password, or certificate turns up in the repository's history, even if it's since been removed from the current tip.
*Usually a symptom of:* Secret management skipped for convenience during initial setup, or a rushed fix nobody circled back to.
*Full treatment:* [Ch 83 — Secrets Management](../part11-security/ch83-secrets-management.md)
*False positive:* A deliberately fake, documented test credential committed for a public example, that was never a real secret at all.

**The Hard-Coded Network Trust Model**
*What you observe:* A service drops input validation on its own endpoints because "it's behind the internal network, so traffic is safe."
*Usually a symptom of:* Treating a network boundary as already-examined instead of the next one to check.
*Full treatment:* [Ch 79 — Threat Modeling](../part11-security/ch79-threat-modeling.md), [Ch 80 — Defense in Depth](../part11-security/ch80-defense-in-depth.md)
*False positive:* A tightly coupled, single-process monolith where a "boundary" is actually just a function call verified by the compiler's own type system — there is no network boundary to have skipped examining.

**Permissions Keep Expanding**
*What you observe:* A service account's permission set only ever grows across changes, never shrinks.
*Usually a symptom of:* Least privilege enforced at grant time and never once revisited after.
*Full treatment:* [Ch 82 — Authentication vs. Authorization](../part11-security/ch82-authentication-vs-authorization.md)
*False positive:* Early platform bootstrap, before responsibilities have been partitioned enough to know what the eventual minimal set should be.

**The Indefinitely Deferred Dependency Upgrade**
*What you observe:* A security advisory stays open release after release because the fix is "too risky to schedule."
*Usually a symptom of:* A dependency graph too brittle to upgrade safely — which is the real problem, and the deferral is just hiding it.
*Full treatment:* [Ch 84 — Dependency Supply Chain Risk](../part11-security/ch84-dependency-supply-chain-risk.md)
*False positive:* Deliberately waiting for a vendor's next release after their first attempted fix shipped its own regression.

---

## 11. Performance Smells

**The N+1 Network Loop**
*What you observe:* A database or request tracer shows one page load executing a hundred near-identical sequential queries or RPCs inside a loop.
*Usually a symptom of:* An access-pattern algorithm mistake — a sequence of round trips standing in for one batched or joined call.
*Full treatment:* [Ch 89 — Data Structure and Algorithm Selection in Practice](../part12-performance/ch89-data-structure-and-algorithm-selection.md), [Ch 04 — Abstraction and Information Hiding](../part01-systems-thinking/ch04-abstraction-and-information-hiding.md), [Ch 18 — Data Ownership Boundaries](../part02-software-architecture/ch18-data-ownership-boundaries.md)
*False positive:* A deliberate, single-row-at-a-time write path for a financial ledger, where individual transactional visibility is a correctness requirement, not an oversight.

**The Toy-Dataset Warm-Cache Illusion**
*What you observe:* A local micro-benchmark reports a function taking nanoseconds; the same code under production data and concurrency takes orders of magnitude longer.
*Usually a symptom of:* A benchmark small enough to live entirely in cache, hiding the memory-access cost that dominates once real scale shows up.
*Full treatment:* [Ch 86 — Profiling-First](../part12-performance/ch86-profiling-first.md), [Ch 89 — Data Structure and Algorithm Selection in Practice](../part12-performance/ch89-data-structure-and-algorithm-selection.md)
*False positive:* A pure, self-contained algorithmic unit test whose entire purpose is checking correctness, not performance.

**The Thundering Herd Database Collapse**
*What you observe:* The instant a popular cache key expires, database CPU usage spikes to saturation within seconds.
*Usually a symptom of:* A cache stampede — every concurrent request regenerating the same expired entry at once, with no coalescing or lock anywhere in sight.
*Full treatment:* [Ch 88 — Caching: Layers, Invalidation, Failure Modes](../part12-performance/ch88-caching.md)
*False positive:* A deliberate write-through path where every mutation is expected to reach the database immediately regardless of cache state.

**Performance Optimizations With No Measurement Attached**
*What you observe:* A pull request introduces a materially more complex implementation for the sake of speed, with no benchmark, profile, or production number attached to justify it.
*Usually a symptom of:* An assumed bottleneck doing the job a measured one should have done.
*Full treatment:* [Ch 85 — When to Optimize (and When Not To)](../part12-performance/ch85-when-to-optimize.md), [Ch 86 — Profiling-First](../part12-performance/ch86-profiling-first.md)
*False positive:* An emergency mitigation shipped during an active, already-measured production incident, with formal benchmarking following once the fire is out.
