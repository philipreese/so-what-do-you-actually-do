# Chapter 3 — Coupling and Cohesion

**Prerequisites:** [Ch 01 — What Engineering Actually Optimizes](ch01-what-engineering-optimizes.md), [Ch 02 — Complexity Is the Enemy](ch02-complexity-is-the-enemy.md). Specifically: accidental complexity, cost of change, and state as a complexity source.

**New vocabulary introduced:** coupling, cohesion, afferent coupling (Ca), efferent coupling (Ce), instability metric, connascence, distributed monolith, shotgun surgery

**Key takeaways:**
- Coupling and cohesion are independent axes, not opposites. A component can have high cohesion and high coupling simultaneously. The goal is both: high cohesion within components, low coupling between them.
- High cohesion reduces local complexity. Low coupling reduces global complexity. You need both.
- Not all coupling is equal. The connascence taxonomy describes *how strongly* two components are coupled — weak (name, type) vs. strong (timing, execution order). Strong connascence is the coupling that breaks silently at runtime.
- Most real systems fail from hidden coupling, not from lack of cohesion. Hidden coupling is the worst case: it behaves like tight coupling but looks like loose coupling.
- Co-change frequency in version history is often the most honest measure of coupling — more reliable than dependency graphs alone.

## Purpose

Most system design arguments about coupling and cohesion collapse because engineers use these terms as aesthetic complaints rather than measurable properties. "This feels tightly coupled" produces arguments. "This component has efferent dependencies on eleven services and an instability score of 0.92" produces decisions.

This chapter makes both concepts precise enough to reason about and act on. It also distinguishes them clearly — they are frequently conflated, but they describe different problems at different scales.

Coupling is about the relationship *between* components: how a change in one propagates to another. Cohesion is about the internal consistency *within* a component: whether the things it does belong together.

Later chapters apply these concepts at specific scales — dependency direction in architecture (Part II, Ch 12), API surface design (Part II, Ch 15), and module file structure (Part IV, Ch 27). This chapter establishes the underlying concepts.

## Coupling: What It Is and Why Form Matters

**What it is:** Coupling is the degree to which one component's behavior depends on another component's state, structure, or timing. The critical distinction is not whether coupling exists — in any useful system, it will — but what *form* it takes.

**Why it exists:** No system is truly isolated. Any useful system interacts with others: databases, services, files, APIs. The form of those interactions determines how fragile the system becomes when either side changes.

**Options:**
1. **Tight coupling** — shared state, shared schemas, synchronous direct dependencies
2. **Loose coupling** — communication through stable interfaces, isolated state, message passing
3. **Implicit coupling** — undocumented contracts, shared assumptions, timing dependencies that no one stated explicitly

**Trade-offs:**

| Form | Change tolerance | Performance | Debuggability | Risk |
|------|-----------------|-------------|--------------|------|
| Tight | Low — changes propagate immediately | Higher — no boundary overhead | High — behavior is local | Breaks on evolution |
| Loose | High — boundaries absorb change | Lower — boundary overhead exists | Moderate — failures may be remote | Survives independent evolution |
| Implicit | None — breaks without warning | Variable | Very low — failure modes are invisible | Highest |

Implicit coupling is the worst case specifically because it is invisible. It behaves like tight coupling but passes code review as loose coupling. Two services that are "independently deployed" but coordinate through undocumented event ordering assumptions or shared Redis key conventions are implicitly tightly coupled.

**When to choose each:**
- *Tight:* In-process modules, kernel subsystems, SQLite internals — components that will always be deployed and changed together.
- *Loose:* Service boundaries, inter-team interfaces, anything that must evolve independently.
- *Implicit:* Never intentionally. It appears as technical debt during rapid development and must be made explicit before it causes incidents.

**Common failure modes:**
- Microservices sharing PostgreSQL table schemas directly. The service boundary is nominal; the coupling is real and is located in the schema.
- "Independent" services coordinated through an implicit timing assumption — service B works only if service A has finished within a certain window, but no contract states this.
- A refactor in one service breaks others with no interface change, because the actual contract was never the stated interface.

**Example:** Unix pipes are loosely coupled by design. `grep`, `awk`, and `sort` communicate only through a byte stream — the minimal possible contract. Each tool can be rewritten, replaced, or extended without any change to its neighbors. The contract is so thin that it has survived fifty years of Unix evolution without modification. **[Consensus: prefer loose coupling at all system boundaries that will evolve independently]**

## Afferent vs. Efferent Coupling

**What it is:** Afferent coupling (Ca) is the number of external components that depend on a given component — its inbound dependency count. Efferent coupling (Ce) is the number of external components a given component depends on — its outbound dependency count. These measure different risks.

**Why it matters:** Ca measures impact surface — if you change this component, how much breaks? Ce measures fragility — how many upstream changes can break this component?

**The instability metric:** Robert C. Martin's instability formula quantifies this:

```
I = Ce / (Ca + Ce)
```

- I = 0: maximally stable — many things depend on this, it depends on nothing. Hard to change without widespread consequences.
- I = 1: maximally unstable — nothing depends on this, it depends on many things. Easy to change but breaks constantly as its dependencies evolve.

Neither extreme is inherently good. The question is whether the instability of each component is *appropriate* for its role.

**Options:**
1. **High Ca / Low Ce (The Core)** — a foundational component that many things depend on and that depends on little
2. **Low Ca / High Ce (The Orchestrator)** — a component that coordinates many others but is depended on by nothing
3. **High Ca / High Ce (The Hub)** — a central component with many dependencies in both directions
4. **Low Ca / Low Ce (The Utility)** — an isolated component depended on by few and depending on few

**Trade-offs:**

| Profile | Change safety | Fragility | Example |
|---------|--------------|-----------|---------|
| High Ca / Low Ce | Low — changes cascade outward | Low | PostgreSQL internals, libc, logging libraries |
| Low Ca / High Ce | High — nothing breaks if you change it | High — breaks on any upstream change | UI layers, API gateways |
| High Ca / High Ce | Very low — a systemic risk | Very high | Architecture smell; avoid |
| Low Ca / Low Ce | High | Low | CLI utilities, pure functions |

**When to choose each:**
- *High Ca / Low Ce:* Standard libraries, data structures, foundational infrastructure. These must be heavily tested, carefully versioned, and changed rarely.
- *Low Ca / High Ce:* User-facing layers, entry points, orchestration services. These should be easy to rewrite because their job is to change as business requirements change.
- *High Ca / High Ce:* This profile is almost always accidental. A component that accumulated this shape is a systemic risk — a change to any of its efferent dependencies can cascade to all of its afferent dependents. Refactor to reduce one side.

**Common failure modes:**
- A core service gains a new efferent dependency (increasing Ce). That dependency introduces instability. Now every system depending on the core is exposed to that instability.
- An orchestration layer accumulates afferent dependencies as teams find it convenient to call into. It is now a hub: hard to change and fragile.

**Example:** The left-pad incident in the NPM ecosystem (2016). `left-pad` was eleven lines of code that padded strings with leading characters. It had massive afferent coupling — Babel, React, and thousands of other packages depended on it — and essentially zero efferent coupling. When the author unpublished it, the entire JavaScript build ecosystem broke simultaneously, over a package most of its dependents had never heard of and would not have been able to name if asked. The package's High Ca / Low Ce profile meant a single decision by a single person caused a global cascade. The ecosystem had not recognized the risk of High Ca components controlled by untrusted third parties with no governance. **[Strong Recommendation: treat high-Ca components as infrastructure — they need versioning, governance, and stability guarantees regardless of their apparent simplicity]**

## Connascence: The Strength of Coupling

**What it is:** Connascence is a taxonomy for describing how strongly two components are coupled, based on the nature of their dependency. Two components are connascent if a change in one requires a change in the other to maintain correctness. The taxonomy orders forms of connascence from weakest (easiest to manage) to strongest (most fragile).

**Why it exists:** Saying two components are "coupled" is too coarse. Components that share a function name are coupled. Components that must be called in a specific order are also coupled. These are not equivalent — one breaks on rename and is caught by a compiler; the other breaks silently at runtime under concurrency. The connascence taxonomy gives engineers vocabulary to distinguish them.

**The taxonomy, ordered weak to strong:**

| Form | Description | Detectable by | Example |
|------|-------------|--------------|---------|
| **Name** | Components depend on a shared identifier | Compiler / static analysis | Calling a function by name; an API route |
| **Type** | Components agree on the type of a value | Compiler / type checker | JSON schema; protobuf contract |
| **Value** | Components depend on a specific value | Tests / review | Magic numbers; shared sentinel strings |
| **Execution order** | A must happen before B | Integration tests | authenticate() before fetchData() |
| **Timing** | A must complete within a time window for B to work | Load testing / production only | Distributed timeouts; async ordering |

**The engineering goal:** Push coupling toward the top of the table. Connascence of Name and Type is caught by compilers and static analysis. Connascence of Timing is only detected in production, often during incidents.

**Trade-offs:**
- *Weak connascence (Name, Type):* Refactoring is automated and safe. Violations are caught before deployment. Requires explicit interface definitions — schemas, types, contracts.
- *Strong connascence (Timing, Execution order):* Requires less upfront interface definition. Breaks silently at runtime. Requires deep system knowledge to diagnose.

**When to choose each:**
- *Weak connascence:* Default for all inter-component interfaces, API boundaries, and service contracts. This is nearly always the right answer.
- *Strong connascence:* Acceptable only in extreme performance-critical paths where explicit synchronization overhead is computationally prohibitive — lock-free data structures, embedded systems memory management. These cases are narrow and should be documented explicitly.

**Common failure modes:**
- **Temporal coupling:** An API client requires `authenticate()` to be called before `fetchData()`. The dependency is not expressed in types or interfaces — only in documentation. A developer calls `fetchData()` first. The system crashes in a way that is not obvious from the stack trace. The coupling was connascence of execution order, and no tool enforced it.
- **Hardcoded values crossing boundaries:** A status code string is duplicated across five services as a literal. When one service changes its status taxonomy, the others continue accepting the old values silently. The connascence of value was never made explicit.
- **Kubernetes controller loops:** Controllers rely on eventual consistency and timing of reconciliation loops. Debugging "stuck pods" often requires reasoning about timing connascence — which loop ran when, in what order — rather than logical errors in any single component.

**Example:** Unix pipes effectively eliminate strong connascence. `ls` and `grep` are coupled only by Connascence of Type — they both agree to read and write byte streams — and Connascence of Name — standard input and standard output. There is no Connascence of Timing or Execution Order. They can be composed in any combination without systemic failure, which is why `ls | grep | sort | awk` pipelines built in the 1970s still work today. **[Consensus: engineer toward weak connascence at all boundaries; treat any instance of Connascence of Timing as a design risk requiring explicit documentation]**

## Measuring Coupling in Practice

**What it is:** Coupling can be approximated through several methods, each capturing a different dimension of the actual dependency relationship. The key insight is that the dependency graph in the code is not the only — or always the most accurate — measure of real coupling.

**Why it matters:** Without measurement, coupling assessments become subjective. "This feels tightly coupled" leads to arguments. Observable signals lead to decisions.

**Options:**

1. **Static analysis — dependency graphs, import graphs, build dependency trees.** Measures declared dependencies. Fast and cheap; catches formal coupling. Misses runtime coupling, timing coupling, and data coupling that operates through shared schemas rather than code imports.

2. **Change-based analysis — co-change frequency in version history.** Files or modules that change together frequently are effectively coupled, regardless of what the dependency graph shows. `git log` over a period of months reveals the actual coupling that engineers act on, not just the coupling they declared. This is often the most honest signal.

3. **Runtime correlation — failure blast radius analysis.** Which components fail together? Which components produce correlated error spikes? This reveals coupling that static analysis and even change history cannot — especially timing coupling and environmental coupling through shared infrastructure.

4. **Instability metric computation.** Counting Ca and Ce for each component and computing I = Ce/(Ca + Ce) across the codebase reveals structural risk: high-Ca/high-Ce components are hubs that warrant architectural attention.

**When to use each:**
- *Static analysis:* Code review, early-stage systems, before deployment.
- *Change-based:* Mature systems with several months of Git history. Most useful for identifying unexpected coupling in large monorepos.
- *Runtime correlation:* Production systems with observability infrastructure. Post-incident reviews.
- *Instability metric:* Architectural reviews, before major refactors.

**Common failure modes:**
- Modules that look decoupled in the import graph but always change together in practice. The actual coupling is through shared mental model, shared data format, or co-owned business logic — not through a code import.
- Overestimating decoupling because the coupling is mediated through configuration, environment variables, or timing rather than code dependencies.

**Example:** Large Git repositories like the Linux kernel and Chromium reveal coupling through co-change frequency: files that change together in the same commit, repeatedly, over months, are effectively coupled even when no explicit dependency exists in the code. This is change-based coupling — the strongest signal that two things actually belong together or need a cleaner interface between them.

## Cohesion

**What it is:** Cohesion measures how closely related the responsibilities within a single component are. A highly cohesive component does one logical thing. A low-cohesion component mixes unrelated responsibilities.

**Why it matters:** Low cohesion creates internal complexity — the component accumulates state and logic that interact in ways that are difficult to predict. It also creates hidden coupling: if unrelated responsibilities share internal state, changes to one responsibility unexpectedly affect the other.

**The cohesion spectrum:**

| Level | Description | Signal |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| **High** | Single, tightly aligned responsibility | Changing one thing rarely requires touching other things |
| **Functional** | All elements contribute to one well-defined operation | Unit tests are focused and fast |
| **Sequential** | Elements process output of one step as input to next | Natural pipeline structure |
| **Communicational** | Elements operate on the same data | Reasonable grouping |
| **Logical** | Elements grouped by category, not by function | Often a symptom of early over-generalization |
| **Low (Coincidental)** | Elements grouped arbitrarily | Changes require touching many unrelated things |

**When to choose each:**
- High/functional cohesion is the default target for all components. Every module should be able to answer the question "what does this do?" with one sentence.
- Lower cohesion is acceptable temporarily during rapid development but should be treated as technical debt: it is a signal that the component needs to be split.

**Common failure modes:**
- **The utility module:** A file named `utils.js`, `helpers.py`, or `common.go` that accumulates unrelated functions over time — the codebase's junk drawer, and just as hard to find anything in. By definition low cohesion — grouped by convenience, not by logical relationship.
- **Shotgun surgery:** A single conceptual change — adding a new user role, changing a date format — requires modifying many files scattered across the codebase. This is the symptom of low cohesion: the concept is not owned by any one component.
- **Mixed responsibilities:** A service that handles authentication, applies business logic, and writes to the database in the same class or function. Changing the authentication mechanism requires understanding the business logic. Changing the persistence layer requires understanding the authentication flow.

**Example:** SQLite maintains high cohesion by integrating storage, indexing, and query execution into a single coherent boundary. There is no query engine service separate from a storage engine service. This tight internal integration is appropriate because these responsibilities are genuinely interdependent — the query planner must know about storage layout to generate efficient plans. The cohesion reflects the actual structure of the problem.

## Why Smart Engineers Disagree

The most persistent coupling disagreement is over the DRY principle — Don't Repeat Yourself.

Engineers who prioritize **deduplication** abstract any repeated logic into a shared module. Three services that format dates differently get a shared `DateFormatter`. They argue this increases cohesion by putting all date logic in one place.

Engineers who prioritize **autonomy** copy the date formatting logic into each service — sometimes called WET (Write Everything Twice). They argue the shared utility creates artificial afferent coupling between services that have no other relationship.

Both positions are locally correct. The resolution is in a distinction the DRY principle glosses over: **identical code is not necessarily identical logic. If the reasons for changing are different, they must not be coupled.**

If Service A and Service B format dates the same way today but for independent business reasons — Service A for an API payload, Service B for a database index — their future changes will diverge. Coupling them through a shared formatter means one service cannot change its date format without coordination with the other. The shared module became a coupling point masquerading as good design.

The practical question is not "is this code duplicated?" but "do the reasons for changing this code in these two places have anything to do with each other?" If yes, deduplicate. If no, the duplication is cheaper than the coupling.

**The larger disagreement:** Some engineers optimize for minimizing coupling aggressively, accepting the coordination overhead of strict boundaries. Others prioritize cohesion first, preferring larger integrated modules that reduce fragmentation. A third camp accepts coupling but focuses on making it explicit and observable.

These are defensible positions. Unix represents one extreme — minimal coupling via pipes, each tool entirely independent. SQLite represents another — high internal coupling with high cohesion, a deliberately integrated system that rejects external decomposition. Most systems need to reason about where on this spectrum each of their components should sit, rather than applying a uniform strategy everywhere.
